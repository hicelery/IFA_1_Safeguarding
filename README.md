## Project Goals


This project aims to use a sleek and bold design to highlight only the most important information.
This will use bootstrap to make our 3 main sections responsive, with 2 cards grouped by background colour.
For desktops this will show as a 2x3 grid, and fold to a single 1x6 column on tablets and below.

## Deployment and workflow

This project is deployed through github pages and follows a simplified agile gitflow methodology. Main branch is preserved as the deployed and live branch, whilst all development work will be conducted on feature branches. Code deployments to the live project environment will only available through a pull request to main.
All feautures must be tested on the 'develop' branch before being considered a release candidate to main. This ensures the deployed project maintains a stable codebase, and provides a scaleable workflow should the project scope increase and more developers were required to join the project.
