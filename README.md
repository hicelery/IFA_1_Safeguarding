## Deployment and workflow

This project is deployed through github pages and follows a simplified agile gitflow methodology. Main branch is preserved as the deployed and live branch, whilst all development work will be conducted on feature branches. Code deployments to the live project environment will only available through a pull request to main.
All feautures must be tested on the 'develop' branch before being considered a release candidate to main. This ensures the deployed project maintains a stable codebase, and provides a scaleable workflow should the project scope increase and more developers were required to join the project.
